# VLSI-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-OPTIMIZED-DIRECT-FORM-CASCADE-FIR-FILTER-FOR-LOW-POWER-AREA-AND-DELAY
the design and implementation of a low power, high speed 16  order FIR filter. For the multiplication of filter coefficient with filter input, different multiplication  techniques such as Vedic multiplier, Array multiplier and Booth multiplier are used to optimize  filter area, delay, and power.
